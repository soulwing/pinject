Pinject
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soulwing/pinject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soulwing/pinject)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.soulwing/pinject/badge.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aorg.soulwing%20a%3Apinject*)

A CDI extension that injects property values into CDI-managed beans.  By
simply adding a `@Property` qualifier to your injection points,
and putting the corresponding property value in a properties file or system
property that can be located by the extension, you can inject properties 
for strings, numbers, URLs, etc.  By providing your own property converters, 
the extension can inject property values of almost any type that has a 
well-defined string representation.  Moreover, by providing your own
custom resolver, you can resolve property values in practically any manner 
that suits the needs of your application. 

Binary Distribution
